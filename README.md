# hashcat-php-API
Under Development

First use the ./setup.sh in order to prepare all files automatically, once its done your API should be ready.
(The setup.sh is only tested on ubuntu/debian, requires modification in order to work with redhat based linux machines)

Usage: yourwebsite.x/hashcat.php?hash=HASH&wordlist=WORDLISTFILENAME&rule=RULEFILENAME
